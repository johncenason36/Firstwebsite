    </h1>
    My First website!
    <p> <!-- This is used to make actual paragraphs. Even if i put indents in body it would just clump
    it together so I need indents.-->
        My first ever website. I'll be continously adding stuff to it and hopefully by the end this will be a sort of decent
        website. We're going through the playlist and we'll be using this website as a dummy site. And I hope to internalize how to make a website
        by the end of this. 
    <p>
        This is my 2nd paragraph! And it will actually form this time. It's gonna actually turn into a paragraph now.
    </p>
    <p> In this paragraph Imma use bold and italics. Like <strong> Chicken Nuggets are so damn good</strong> will be in bold and <em> onion rings are better than fries</em> will be in italics
    </p>
    <!-- strong and em actually change the way a screen reader would read your text but using <b> and <i> would allow for a visual bold and italic but it wouldn't change the way a screen reader would read that text. -->
