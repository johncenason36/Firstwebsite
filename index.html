    </h1>
    My First website!
    <p> <!-- This is used to make actual paragraphs. Even if i put indents in body it would just clump
    it together so I need indents.-->
        My first ever website. I'll be continously adding stuff to it and hopefully by the end this will be a sort of decent
        website. We're going through the playlist and we'll be using this website as a dummy site. And I hope to internalize how to make a website
        by the end of this. 
    <p>
        This is my 2nd paragraph! And it will actually form this time. It's gonna actually turn into a paragraph now.
    </p>
    <p> 
        In this paragraph Imma use bold and italics. Like <strong> Chicken Nuggets are so damn good</strong> will be in bold and <em> onion rings are better than fries</em> will be in italics
    </p>
    <!-- strong and em actually change the way a screen reader would read your text but using <b> and <i> would allow for a visual bold and italic but it wouldn't change the way a screen reader would read that text. -->

    <h2> Ordered lists</h2>
    <p>
        Top 5 foods in the world
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Pizza: just a comfort food and really hard to mess up. I've never had a bad pizza</li>
        <li> Sushi: doesn't really matter which type it usually always hits</li>
        <li> A baked potato with sourcream and cheese only: truly one of the best sides out there</li>
        <li> Fresh motzerella sticks: no explanation needed</li>
        <li> Hot dogs: again another comfort food and just really hard to mess up</li>
    </ol>
    <!--<a> click me</a> This is because an anchor tag on its own 
        won’t know where we want to link to. We have to tell it a destination to go to. 
        We do this by using an HTML attribute.
        An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the element’s 
        opening tag. An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value; however,
        ot all attributes require a value. In our case, we need to add a href (hyperlink reference) 
        attribute to the opening anchor tag. The value of the href attribute is the destination 
        we want our link to go to.
    -->
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me to learn how I'm doing this</a>
    </p>
    <!--By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without a href attribute will look like plain text. 
        If the href attribute is present,the browser will give the text a blue color 
        and underline it to signify it is a link.-->
    <!-- this opens the odinproject page in the same tab to open it in a different tab we need to add
          a target to the opening tag. -->
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click me to go to a new tab</a>
    </p>
    <!-- the target = "_blank" is what causes a new tab to open but the rel = no opener and no referrer are 
    security lines. You can go to the oden project links and images to learn more about it. It's just good
    to have-->
    <!-- Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. Like the link for odin project-->
    <p>
        <a href="about.html">About</a> 
    </p>
    <!-- Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Like the one to the about page-->
    <!-- This works because the index and about page are in the same directory. 
        That means we can simply use its name (about.html) as the link’s href value.
        But we will usually want to organize our website directories a little better. 
        Normally we would only have the index.html at the root directory and all other HTML files in 
        their own directory. Now that link will be broken this is how we do it when its in a new directory-->
    <p>
        <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
